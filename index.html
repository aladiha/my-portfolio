                <h3 style="color: gray;">How I ended up majoring in software engineering?</h3>
                <p>When i first graduated highschool i had no idea what i wanted to be or what i really love to do, 
                    my parents wanted me to study civil engineering and since i never knew what i wanted to study i didn't mind,
                    so in 2015 i started my civil engineering journey which didn't last much, 
                    in my first year i had this one course where we learn Programming, in C language specificaly, in my eyes that course was different, 
                    what i realy liked about it that you don't have a set of roles to follow to get the right answer, 
                    there are several ways to solve a specific problem which needed creative out of the box thinking, and yes as a surprise i got a higher grade than all my other courses.
                    that day i knew what i love to do and want to be, a software engineer!
                </p>
                <p>
                    so as you might guess after my first year in civil engineering has ended, i moved to software engineering department, and this time i started my real journey!
                </p>
                
                <h3 style="color: gray;">B.Sc in software engineering</h3>
                <p>graduated my software engineering degree in october 2020 with specilization in cyber security from SCE college of engineering, Beersheba with a GPA of 83.</p>
                <p>As of my second year at college I worked as a C/C++ mentor to help students who had difficulties understanding Programming in general, specialy first year students.</p>

                <h3 style="color: gray;">Excellenteam C++ / Python programming bootcamp</h3>
                <p>In october 2020 i was accepted to participate in excellenteam bootcamp, an intensive 15 weeks day-to-day training, where we learned how to write an efficient clean code,
                     gain industry skills and be prepared for the job market, we also worked on an interesting projects for mobileye and google.</p>
                
                <p>I graduated the bootcamp successfuly in january 2021.</p>  
                <h3 style="color: gray;">Fullstack Time!</h3>
